Hi!

In this project, I have 9 modules that somehow help me keep track of several things:

1. Contact: Helps me keep track of friends and family, especially their birthdays with automatic e-mails.
2. Farming: Helps me keep track of my farming.
3. Farming work: Keeping track of salary when I work for my father in the forest.
4. Frozen food: Keeping an eye on all the meat from the hunt. Receive automatic emails when the meat needs to be eaten at the latest.
5. ManagerZone: Under construction. A football game I played for over 20 years. Keep track of wins and losses on players transfers.
6. Hunting: Under construction. Keep track of most things for hunting on our own lands.
7. Share (stocks): Under construction. Keep track of my share transactions. An integration with Avanza (Excel files).
8. Shopping list: I live in three places in Sweden. With this list, I know what to buy with me when I go to these places.
9. Trips: Keep checking where I traveled.
